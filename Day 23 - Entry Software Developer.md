### 1. **What Software Development Entails and the Key Tasks of a Developer**

#### Explanation:

Software development is the process of conceiving, designing, programming, testing, and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components. It is an iterative process often guided by software development life cycles (SDLC) like Agile, Waterfall, or DevOps.

#### Key Tasks of a Developer:

1. **Requirement Analysis**:
    
    - Understanding the client’s needs and constraints.
    - Collaborating with stakeholders to define functional and non-functional requirements.
2. **Design**:
    
    - Creating architectural plans.
    - Choosing appropriate algorithms and design patterns.
3. **Implementation**:
    
    - Writing and testing code.
    - Following coding standards and practices.
4. **Testing and Debugging**:
    
    - Running unit tests and integration tests.
    - Fixing bugs and ensuring code correctness.
5. **Deployment**:
    
    - Preparing software for production.
    - Configuring deployment environments.
6. **Maintenance**:
    
    - Updating features and fixing issues post-release.
    - Ensuring software remains functional with changing requirements.

### 2. **Day-to-Day Activities and Required Skills of a Software Developer**

#### Daily Activities:

1. **Coding and Reviewing**:
