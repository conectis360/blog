**Day 5: Custom Exceptions: Because Sometimes Java Just Doesn’t Get It**

There are times when the built-in Java exceptions just aren’t expressive enough. It’s like trying to explain a complex feeling, but the words don’t exist. So what do we do? We create custom exceptions!

## Creating Custom Exceptions

Custom exceptions allow you to express specific problems unique to your application. Think of it as adding your own flair to the language.

```java
public class AgeValidationException extends Exception {
    public AgeValidationException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

Now you have your very own exception—like a bespoke suit, but for your code. By defining custom exceptions, you can make error handling much more expressive and meaningful.

## When to Use Custom Exceptions

1. **Specific Business Logic**: When you have domain-specific errors that don’t quite fit Java’s built-in exceptions, creating your own makes error handling more readable and contextually appropriate.
```java 
public void validateAge(int age) throws AgeValidationException {
    if (age < 0) {
        throw new AgeValidationException("Age cannot be negative.");
    }
}
```

2. **Hierarchical Exception Handling**: Custom exceptions can form a hierarchy, allowing you to catch specific exceptions at different levels in your code.
```java 
public class InvalidInputException extends Exception {
    // General invalid input exception
}

public class InvalidAgeException extends InvalidInputException {
    // Specific invalid age exception
}
```

3. **Clarity for Your Team**: Instead of throwing a generic `IllegalArgumentException`, create exceptions that are more descriptive and understandable to others working with your code.

## Catching Custom Exceptions

When you create custom exceptions, you handle them the same way you handle built-in exceptions. Here’s how you might handle our `AgeValidationException`:

```java 
try {
    validateAge(-5);
} catch (AgeValidationException e) {
    System.out.println("Caught exception: " + e.getMessage());
}
```

## Why Custom Exceptions Matter

Custom exceptions give you more control over your error-handling logic and make it easier to understand what's going wrong. They also give you a structured way to define and manage errors that are unique to your application.
